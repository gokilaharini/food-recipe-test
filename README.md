# test configuration for recipe model
This project leverages deep learning techniques to automatically classify food images into various categories such as fruits, vegetables, fast food, and beverages. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a labeled dataset of food images, the model can identify and categorize different food items with high accuracy. The system can be used in health apps, calorie tracking tools, or smart kitchen assistants to enhance user experience and dietary monitoring.
